# ClauseFlag
ClauseFlag is an end-to-end ML platform that unmasks predatory "fine print" in Terms of Service. It uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT pipeline and anomaly detection to classify legal clauses by risk level (Safe/Watch/Danger). Built with FastAPI, React, and Redis, it turns dense legal jargon into actionable, human-readable insights.
